# Compute

An operating system manages all of the software and hardware on the computer in which there are several programs that
they run at the same time and need access to the central processing unit CPU, memory and storage
of computers because the operating system coordinates and guarantees that all programs get what they want.
they need.

 # Types of operating systems

1. Windows.
2. Mac OS.
3. Unix
4. Linux
5. Solaris
6. Google Chrome

# Available Operating Systems at AWS
 Amazon has a variety of operating systems which can be used in virtual machines such as EC2 among others.
 information resources. However, there are several resources that can be used in the operating system, these are some of them.
 amazon web services (Supported EC2, Linux, Amazon Linux 2 and Windows On AWS).
 
 # There are four broad categories of compute services. 

 1. Virtual Machines:  is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

 2. Containers: Many different container services including Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry.

 3. Serverless: AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers you pay only for the compute time you consume

 4. Platform as a service: allows a company to focus on building code and applications rather than manage infrastructure.

In AWS, compute is available in three forms: instances, containers, and functions.

# Best Practices for Selecting Compute Resources
1. Evaluate the available compute options
2. Understand the available compute configuration options
3. Collect compute-related metrics
4. Determine the required configuration by right-sizing
5. Use the available elasticity of resources
6. Re-evaluate compute needs based on metrics

In this module I learned about how the operating system works, what compute services there are in AWS, types of compute, and AWS compute services, how to choose the right service
Also know what the four pillars of cost optimization are (Right Size, Increase elasticity, Leverage
the right pricing and Optimize storage and how to use each AWS service.

Which Amazon web service is good to use for Compute?
